title: 'String Methods'
description: 'String Methods are powerful tools to use when working with strings. They enable powerful and unique tools to help you specifically work with string objects.  .'

## Definition: 
All `string methods` are specifically designed to be used with `string objects`. It's important to note that there are some `string-related functions`, such as `len()`, that do not use dot notation and can be accessed by other types of objects as well. However, `string methods` are exclusive to `string objects`.  

## Syntax:
`string_object.string_method()` or `string_function(string).`

## Examples:
<CodeGroup>
```len method.py
len("hello")
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>Donâ€™t use a space with the print statment. It should be written as `print()` not `print ()`.</Tip>
<Warning>You must consider the `type` when printing. `print(32 + "hello")` is a type mismatch, consider using a `str` or `int` function to convert to proper types.</Warning>
