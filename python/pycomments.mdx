title: 'Comments'
---

## Definition:
Comments are parts of code not read by a computer. They are extremely important for other programmers as well as for anyone reading your code. Writing clear comments is an art and can make a huge differece in understanding code and workflow. There are single line and multi-line comments.

<Warning>Please remember that you still need to use a variable to store a user input. `input()` by itself will not store any values.</Warning>

## Syntax:
```python
# Comments goes after the hash symbol
```
```python
""" This is a 
    multi-line comment"""
```

## Examples:

```python comments.py
#Comments can go above code
print("hi)  #comments can go to the right of code
```


<Tip>Use comments to stop a line of code from executing, this is often useful when trying something new or fixing errors.</Tip>
<Tip>Comments will always have a hash symbol in front and will be a different color.</Tip>
