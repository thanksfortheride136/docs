## Definition:
The `input()` function in python will allows user interactivity by typing into the program, this allows you to enhance and make software more complex.

<Warning>Please remember that you still need to use a variable to store a user input. `input()` by itself will not store any values.</Warning>

## Syntax:


```python
variableName = input("Enter string here")
```

## Examples:
<CodeGroup>
```Python Input strings.py
name = input("What is your name? ")
favorite_food = input("What is your favorite food: )
```
```python Input Numbers.py
age = input("Enter Age: ")
days_worked = input("Enter days worked this month: ");
```
```python Prompting for User Input to Continue.py
input("Press any key to continue.. ")
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>Using `input()` without a variable may be useful in scenarius where you want a button press to continue. Please see the third example in Examples</Tip>
<Tip>When using `input()` you often will want to put a space after you </Tip>
