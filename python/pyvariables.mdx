description: 'How we store information in CS.'

## Definition:
Variables are areas in RAM where we store a value. In computer science we can create variables and store many different types of data.
## Syntax:

```python
variableName = 'value'
```

## Examples:
<CodeGroup>
```Python Store Strings.py
name = "Cooper"
greeting = "Hello there, have a nice day!"
level = "level 3"
```
```python Store Number.py
num_of_lives = 9;
days_in_week = 7;
tests = 100;
```
```python Store Boolean.py
is_touching = True
lights_on = False
door_close = False
```
```python Store Calculation.py
addition_problem = 5 + 5 
number_squared = 5 ** 2
factorial = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4
```
```python store complex.py
"""Variables can store other variables within them. The example below will have 3
variables, a variable for length, width and the result of the area Calculation.
Remember variables only store information, if we wanted to print the result we
would use the print() function."""

length = 10
width = 5
rectangle_area = 5  * 10
```

<Tip>The `=` symbole is the comparsion operator in Python, you should not use outside of this context. It is **not** the same as equals.</Tip>
<Warning>Never use spaces in a variable name.</Warning>
<Warning>You cannot name a variable a number.</Warning>
