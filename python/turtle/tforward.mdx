---
## Definition: 
`move()` moves the turtle oject forward a set distance. You must use the name of your turtle object, the forward() method and then an integer as a parameter.

## Syntax:
```python
turtle_name.forward(int)
```
## Examples:
<CodeGroup>
```python forward1.py
t.forward(100)
```
```python forward2.py
turtle1.forward(45)
```
```python forward3.py
jeff.forward(1)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>Donâ€™t use a space with the forward method. It should be written as `forward()` not `forward ()`.</Tip>
<Warning>These methods take `ints` not `floats` (decimals)</Warning>
