title: 'forward() & backward()'
description: 'Forward and backward method from the turtle class.'
---
## Definition: 
`move()` moves the turtle oject forward or backward a set distance. You must use the name of your turtle object, the forward()/backward() method and then an integer as a parameter.

## Syntax:
```python
turtle_name.forward(int or float)
```
```python
turtle_name.backward(int or float)
```
## Examples:
<CodeGroup>
```python forward1.py
t.forward(89)
```
```python backward1.py
turtle1.backward(25)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>Donâ€™t use a space with the forward/backward method. It should be written as `forward()` / `backward()` not `forward ()` / `backward ()`.</Tip>
