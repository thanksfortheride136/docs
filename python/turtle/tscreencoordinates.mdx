description: 'Screens and coordinates when using Python with turtle are important to understand.'

## How the Screen Works: 
'The Turtle screen is a rectangular area where the Turtle moves and draws. The screen can be thought of as coordinate plane, the turtle will start to draw at `(0,0)` which is the middle of the screen.'

<Tip>Its important to know that the turtle will move in the direction its faces, with the exception of some methods.</Tip>
